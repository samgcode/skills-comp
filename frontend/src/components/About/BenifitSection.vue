                <h2>Rapid for work</h2>
                <p>
                    There’s no vacation from being a leader and
                    provider for your family. Late nights and hard 
                    work are a way of life, so what are you doing to 
                    stay healthy? The revitalization of fresh air is 
                    remarkably effective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having Rapid Air is like giving your mind and 
                    body a shot of nature.

                <h2>Rapid for students</h2>
                <p>
                    Excelling at studies requires a focused mind 
                    and the energy to complete your studies. 
                    But the stress of timelines and commitments 
                    quickly drains your body, and performance 
                    suffers.

                <p>
                    Your body will give you all the strength you 
                    need if you feed it the right ingredients. Quality
                    air is one ingredient you shouldn’t overlook.

                    grow optimally. Clean, healthy lungs are what 
                    you want for active children to reach their 
                    potential.
