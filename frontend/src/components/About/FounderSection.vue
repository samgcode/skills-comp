                <h2>Fred Blam</h2>
                <h5>Founder & CEO of RapidAir</h5>
                <p>
                    Fred is the founder of rapidair. His story began as a struggling university 
                    student. Someone who couldn't focus on school as he was distracted 
                    and fascinated with commerce, specifically e-commerce.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mr. Blam. enjoys e-commerce as he feels it helps to make the world a 
                    smaller place. With the Internet, we are able to reach farther than ever 
                    before, and Mr. Blam is able to help others he wouldn't otherwise have 
                    been able to help!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shortly after Fred completed his education at the University of Alberta in 
                    the School of business, personal interests quickly took over. He ran a
                    very successful security business, but mainly dedicated his time in 
                    helping people secure mortgages in the finance world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Fred's passion on providing fresh clean air to everyone, he has 
                    decided to put all of that aside and initiate a business that will allow 
                    people from all over the world to experience health and wellness. Health 
                    and wellness they otherwise would not have been able to experience on 
                    a daily basis. With RapidAir, we are able to bring a essential necessity, 
                    such as fresh clean air to anyone, anywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fred will use his experience in personal security, as well as his sales 
                    experience with mortgages to head up RapidAir to ensure that we are 
                    constantly progressing towards perfection.

                <h2>Jennifer Right</h2>
                <h5>Co-Founder & COO of RapidAir</h5>
                <p>
                    Jennifer is the Co-founder and Chief Operating Officer for Vitalityair. She 
                    brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to this business. As a 
                    former commercial diver and Journeyman Red Seal Welder, Jennifer is 
                    able to have a diverse understanding of the importance of delivering 
                    fresh clean air.
                </p>
                <p>
                   As Jennifer was growing up, he was always the first kid out the door and 
                   the last kid in. Jennifer spent most of her youth being raised outdoors at 
                   the lake. Her values and love of fresh air stemmed from those days at 
                   the lake with her Grandparents. Growing up in Alberta, nature, fresh air 
                   and the great Canadian Rocky Mountains were never hard to find. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jennifer feels right at home with nature. That passion and love for nature 
                    will carry on through the products and our premium air that we will be 
                    delivering to you. We believe that our customers should have the same 
                    opportunity to breathe the fresh air that we do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Jennifer's hands on skills and Fred's passion for e-commerce, we 
                    together will offer an experience like no other. No matter where you
